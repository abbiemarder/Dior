                    <p>Christain Ernest Dior, was born and raised in Normandy, France and moved to Paris with his
                        parents
                        when he was ten
                        years old. He was one of seven children in his family and was the second born. His parents were
                        Maurice and
                        Madeleine in the town of Granville. Dior was always interested in art but his father insisted on
                        a
                        good education.
                        This was where he enrolled atthe prestigious Ecole Des Sciences Politiques in Paris. He finished
                        with degree in
                        Politics which prepared him for the next step in his life.   </p>
